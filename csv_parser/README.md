# CSV Column Analysis Script

This script reads a CSV file and allows you to analyze the frequency of values in a specific column. It provides a summary of the top 10 most frequent entries in the selected column, which can be helpful for understanding data distribution or identifying common patterns in large datasets.

## Features
- **List Columns**: Displays all the columns in the CSV file.
- **Group and Count**: Groups the data by the selected column and counts how many rows each unique value has.
- **Top 10 Results**: Shows the top 10 most frequent values in the selected column, sorted by frequency.
- **Save Results**: Optionally, save the top 10 results to a new CSV file.

## Usage
1. Set the path of the CSV file in the script (or adjust accordingly).
2. Choose the column to analyze when prompted.
3. View the top 10 most frequent entries for that column, and optionally save them to a new CSV.
