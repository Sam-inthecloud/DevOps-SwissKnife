Welcome to **pycloud-swissknife** – a personal collection of versatile Python scripts I've built to automate cloud/DevOps tasks for automating repetitive tasks, and improving efficiency in cloud engineering and data processing. I created this repository as a central place to store these scripts, and I hope it can serve as a helpful resource for others working on similar cloud and DevOps challenges. Whether you're managing cloud infrastructure, working with data, or building automation pipelines, you'll find something useful here. 

This repo is not just for me – it's an open resource, and I'd love for others to contribute, share improvements, or add their own tools. Feel free to fork the repository, open issues, or submit pull requests. 🌱

## **Introduction**

 The goal is to provide a toolkit that helps streamline daily cloud and DevOps workflows. 🌩️

It started as a personal project to automate some of my daily tasks, but I decided to open it up for others to benefit from and contribute to as well. The scripts are simple, efficient, and designed to be flexible enough to adapt to a variety of cloud-related use cases. Think of it as your "Swiss knife" for cloud automation!

## **Scripts**

### 1. **[Image Augmentation](./image_augmentation/)**

This script uses the **Albumentations** library to apply a wide range of transformations to images in your dataset. It's perfect for preparing datasets for machine learning or AI projects. The script includes transformations like brightness/contrast adjustments, rotations, and noise addition. 🔄✨


### 2. **[CSV Parsing](./csv_parser/)**

The CSV parsing script allows you to analyze large CSV datasets by grouping and counting rows based on specific columns. It helps in identifying trends and outliers in the data, making it an ideal tool for data preprocessing . 📊


### 3. **[PDF to Image Converter](./pdf_to_image/)**

Converting PDF files to images is made easy with this script. It uses the **pdf2image** library to convert each page of a PDF document into an image, enabling easier manipulation and processing of documents. 📄➡️📷
